# VQE-H2-LiH
Thanks to the help of Xanadu's VQE overview, I was able to expand on their take of VQE. Their software was used to minimize the energy state of a certain bond length.

I wanted to develop some type of plot to show the ground state of a molecule and iterate through the algorithm for each bond length so that's what I did.

This repository shares the code I used to make this possible and some of the other files I needed for the geometry of the molececules.

In the code provided, I commented in all needed infromation to understad what is happening. I also added the changes to iterate through the process over multiple different bond lengths, and plot the graph. The .xyz files are the seperate bond lengths I used.

If you are interested in this simulation check out the code for how I was able to create a ground energy state graph of H2 and LiH using the Pennylane docummentation!
