# VQE-H2-LiH
Thanks to the help of Xanadu's VQE overview, I was able to expand on their take of VQE. I wanted to develop some time of plot to show the ground state of a molecule and iterate through the algorithm for each bond length so that's what I did.

This repository shows how the code I used to make this possible and some of the other files I needed to actually make this work.

In the code provided, I tried to comment all the important information you need and the changes I made is to iterate the algorithm over multiple different bond lengths, and plot the graph. I also added a bunch of new .xyz files for the geometry of every different geometry at each distance for the molecule.

Make sure to check out how I was able to create a ground energy graph of H2 and LiH using the Pennylane docummentation!
